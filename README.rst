Parsley
=======

An small and simple ingredient parser
-------------------------------------

A small utility to parse ingredients from German recipe instructions using
Regular Expressions. It is currently used at http://restegourmet.de 

**Feel free to fork and extend this!**

Regarding the name
------------------

I didn't want to go with a generic *ingredient-parser* or
something similar (despite many other projects having this name) because I would be the first to be confused whether I should use an underscore, a hyphen or nothing at all. And this being a parser for *food*, Parsley fits just too well.
